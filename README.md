## Todo App

# This is a todo app to demonstrate my understanding of some concepts in javascript such as

- Variables (let, const): Used for storing task data.
- Functions: Event listeners for user actions.
- Control Structures: Used in event handling and task management.
- DOM Manipulation: Adding, removing, and modifying elements dynamically.
- Basic CSS: For styling tasks when marked as completed.
